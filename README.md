# Skin Lesion AI — Quick User Guide

**What it is:** a private, on-device tool that analyzes a single skin-lesion photo and gives plain-English guidance.  
**Not a diagnosis. Not a medical device.**

---

## 1) What you need
- A clear photo of **one** spot on the skin (JPG or PNG).
- Good lighting and focus. No heavy filters or flash glare.

---

## 2) How to use it
1. **Open the app.**
2. Click **Upload** and choose your photo (or drag & drop).
3. Wait a few seconds.
4. Read the **Result** card:
   - A colored **badge** (e.g., *Urgent evaluation*, *Timely visit*, or *Watch and follow-up*).
   - A list of **possible conditions** with percentage bars.
   - A short **explanation** in plain English.

If the app shows **uncertain**, take another photo and consider showing the image to a clinician.

---

## 3) Take a good photo
**Do**
- Use bright, even light (daylight near a window is ideal).
- Hold the camera steady; tap to focus on the spot.
- Fill most of the frame with the lesion; keep it centered.
- Gently move hair away; clean the area (avoid shiny creams).

**Don’t**
- Don’t use harsh flash straight on the skin.
- Don’t include multiple spots in one photo.
- Don’t shoot from far away or at a sharp angle.

---

## 4) Understand the result
- **Urgent evaluation (book dermatologist ASAP)**  
  High suspicion. Arrange professional care soon (especially if new, changing, bleeding, or very dark/irregular).

- **Timely visit (within 1–2 weeks)**  
  Not urgent, but should be checked by a clinician.

- **Watch and follow-up**  
  No urgent signs detected. Re-photograph in **2–4 weeks** under similar lighting and compare for changes.

> If a spot changes quickly, bleeds, or worries you, **seek medical advice regardless of the app’s output.**

---

## 5) Privacy
- Photos are processed **only on your device**.
- No cloud upload or sharing.

---

## 6) When **not** to use this app
- Children and infants.
- Lesions on nails, lips, or inside the mouth/eyes/genitals.
- Large rashes or many spots at once.
- Emergency symptoms (rapid growth, bleeding, pain, fever): **seek care**.
